# Time_Series
Updation to the code starts from the R2 Score(Linear Regression Model), where we had add additional models for the experiment purpose like starting with regression model and then moving towards Random Forest. Also, a comparison was made between regression, decision tree and MLP which was also plotted.
Testing of the methodlogy on the new dataset was also done to conclude the effectiveness. 
Experiment with changing some of the model parameters to create an upgraded version of the existing methodology.

RESULT-
The Wavenet CNN model demonstrated exceptional accuracy in forecasting time series data, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.898. It outperformed traditional LSTM and RNN models, which showed higher MAEs and less stability in predictions. Wavenet's efficiency is enhanced by dilated convolutions, enabling broad sequence processing with lower computational costs. Its consistent performance and fast convergence make it highly suitable for predictive analytics in dynamic environments.
